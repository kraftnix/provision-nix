# Stage 1 Boot / initrd

There are two main ways to do stage-1 boot in NixOS; via systemd or NixOS' custom stage-1 initrd script.

This module focuses on easing configuration of unlocking encrypted disks over SSH during stage-1,
and provides support for both systemd and scripted stage-1 as targets.
